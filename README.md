## Platforms

### LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular online platform for coding practice. It offers a variety of problems categorized by difficulty and topic. Our solutions for LeetCode problems can be found in the `LeetCode` directory.

### Codeforces

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is a competitive programming platform that hosts contests regularly. It provides a wide range of challenging problems. Solutions to Codeforces problems are available in the `Codeforces` directory.

### HackerRank

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is another platform for practicing coding problems and participating in contests. Solutions to HackerRank problems are stored in the `HackerRank` directory.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Check out my array implementations and problem solutions in the `DataStructures/Arrays` directory.

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element points to the next. Visit the `DataStructures/LinkedLists` directory for implementations and problems.

### Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are abstract data types that follow specific order principles (LIFO for stacks and FIFO for queues). Explore our implementations in the `DataStructures/StacksQueues` directory.

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges. The `DataStructures/Trees` directory contains various tree implementations and related problems.

### Graphs

Graphs consist of vertices connected by edges and are used to represent networks. Our graph implementations and problem solutions are in the `DataStructures/Graphs` directory.

### Heaps

Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. Find our heap implementations in the `DataStructures/Heaps` directory.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables store key-value pairs and provide fast data retrieval. Check out our hash table implementations in the `DataStructures/HashTables` directory.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order. Our implementations of various sorting algorithms can be found in the `Algorithms/Sorting` directory.

### Searching

Searching algorithms are used to find elements within data structures. Visit the `Algorithms/Searching` directory for different searching techniques.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Our dynamic programming solutions are in the `Algorithms/DynamicProgramming` directory.

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make local optimal choices at each step. Find our greedy algorithm solutions in the `Algorithms/GreedyAlgorithms` directory.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. Our backtracking solutions are in the `Algorithms/Backtracking` directory.

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms deal with the properties and structures of graphs. Explore our graph algorithm solutions in the `Algorithms/GraphAlgorithms` directory.

### String Algorithms

String algorithms are used to solve problems related to strings. Check out our solutions in the `Algorithms/StringAlgorithms` directory.
